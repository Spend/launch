# Spend Hub Mainnet

The current Spend Version of the Cosmos Hub mainnet:

## Spend Hub Launch

This is the Interchain Foundation's recommendation for the Genesis Block Release
Software and marks the initiation of [phase
one](https://blog.cosmos.network/the-3-phases-of-the-cosmos-hub-mainnet-fdff3a68c4c0) of the Spend Hub launch.

Please be aware that there is no guarantee a network will start from this
recommendation - nodes and validators may never come online, the community may disregard the
recommendation and choose different genesis files, and/or they may modify the
software in arbitrary ways. Such outcomes and many more are outside the Interchain
Foundation's control and completely in the hands of the community.

The recommended genesis file is [genesis.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spend/launch/master/genesis.json).

## Seed Nodes
